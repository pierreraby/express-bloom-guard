# express-bloom-guard

Middleware for Express using a BloomFilter to revoke tokens.  

This repository is for testing and benchmarking purposes only.  

To launch the server, client, etc. in the benchmarks directory, use the command of your favorite package manager, such as  

`pnpm run bench`. see package.json scripts

The revoker and its API server clients centralize token management.
This is a POC for testing purposes only and to have fun coding it 😉.
IMPLEMENTATION IN PROGRESS
